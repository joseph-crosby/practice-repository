It started when an alien device did what it did
And stuck it's self upon his wrist with secrets that it hid
Now he's got super powers
He's no ordinary kid
He's Ben 10
(Ben 10)

So if you see him you might be in for a big surprise
He'll turn into an alien before your very eyes
He's slimy, creepy, fast, and strong
He's every shape and size
He's Ben 10
(Ben 10)

With all powers he's on the case
Fighting off evil from Earth or space
He'll never stop till he makes them pay
'Cause he's the baddest kid to ever save the day
Ben 10!
(Ben)
(10)
