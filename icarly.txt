I know, you see
Somehow the world will change for me
And be so wonderful

Live life, breathe air
I know somehow we're gonna get there
And feel so wonderful

It's all for real
I'm telling you just how I feel

So wake up the members of my nation
It's your time to be
There's no chance unless you take one
And the time to see
The brighter side of every situation
Some things are meant to be
So give your best and leave the rest to me

Leave it all to me
Leave it all to me
Just leave it all to me
